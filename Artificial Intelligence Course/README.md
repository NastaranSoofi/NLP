 We want to classify each ad to one of the categories based on its title and description.
 we use a bag-of-words model and consider the features as the frequency of each word in each class.

* Unigrams, Bigrams, N-grams:
 To consider sequences of words as tokens to capture more information from the context.
* Effectiveness of Additive Smoothing:
 To avoid assigning a zero probability to any of the classes
* Evaluation metrics:
 Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
